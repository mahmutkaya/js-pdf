# js-pdf

** I used [jsPDF](https://parall.ax/products/jspdf) library to generate PDFs in client-side JavaScript. **

- I create dom elements to render a header, date and a button on html page.
- Button has event listener to download pdf file.

### functions:
- genPdf to generate a pdf file with the desired features using jsPDF library.
- createAndAppend to make easy creating dom elements
- getDate to generate current date as day/month/year
